# CropDiseaseDetector
Crop Disease Detection using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting diseases in crops. Plant diseases can significantly impact crop yield and quality, leading to economic losses for farmers. Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective disease management. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project seeks to provide a tool that can assist farmers in identifying and diagnosing crop diseases accurately and quickly.

# Key Features
Disease Detection: The model will be trained to classify images of crops into healthy or diseased categories, along with identifying the specific disease if present.
Multi-class Classification: It will support the detection of multiple diseases across different types of crops.
User-friendly Interface: The project will include a user-friendly interface (web or mobile-based) for farmers to easily upload images of their crops and receive instant disease diagnosis.
Dataset
The project will utilize publicly available datasets of images containing healthy and diseased crops. These datasets may include images of various crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, wheat, etc., along with annotations specifying the type of disease present (if any).

# Machine Learning Techniques
The following machine learning techniques will be employed in the project:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks and will be used as the primary model architecture.
Transfer Learning: Pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG, ResNet, etc.) will be fine-tuned on the crop disease dataset to leverage existing knowledge and improve model performance.
Data Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming will be applied to augment the dataset and improve model generalization.
Implementation
The project will be implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model training will be conducted on a GPU-enabled environment to accelerate the process. The user interface will be developed using frameworks like Flask (for web applications) or Flutter (for mobile applications).
